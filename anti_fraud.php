                    <h3>What is Whistle blowing?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Whistle blowing is when a worker reports suspected wrongdoing at work. This is officially referred to as ‘making a disclosure in the public interest’. <br> A worker can report things that aren’t right, are illegal or if anyone at work is neglecting their duties, including  
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Someone’s health and safety is in danger;</li>
                        <li>Damage to the environment;</li>
                        <li>A criminal offence;</li>
                        <li>The company isn’t obeying the law (like not having the right insurance); and/or</li>
                        <li>Covering up wrongdoing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h3>EXPLANATORY FORWARD</h3>
                    <p>
                    <?php echo $companyName;  ?> is committed to the highest standards of ethics, honesty, openness and accountability. In line with this commitment and to enhance good Governance, transparency and safeguard the integrity of our institution, the Whistleblowing Policy and Procedure Manual is intended to provide: 

                    <br> <br> (i)An avenue for raising concerns related to any illegal or unethical behavior such as fraud, corruption and other misconduct 

                    <br> <br> (ii)Assurance that those who disclose such information will be adequately protected, and that action would be taken on the disclosure. The guiding principles of the policy emanate from the Bank of England Guidelines for Whistle-Blowing for Banks and Other Financial Institutions in the United Kingdom (Guidelines) which mandates Banks to establish adequate whistleblowing procedures and render quarterly returns to the Bank of England on all related breaches. <br> According to the intent of this policy, and in line with the Bank of England Guidelines, whistle-blowing is the reporting of alleged unethical conduct of employees, management, directors and other stakeholders by an employee or other person to appropriate authorities.

                    <br> <br>The Whistle-Blowing Policy aims to create a work environment where employees, vendors, service providers, customers and other stakeholders can raise concerns on misconduct, irregularities or malpractices, without fear of harassment and/or victimization and with an assurance that their concerns will be taken seriously and investigated, and the outcome duly communicated. Employees are internal whistle blowers who report incidents of misconduct in an organization involving a peer/colleague, a supervisor or indeed a top management official. External whistle-blowers who are mostly customers/suppliers report wrong doings of employees to the Chief Audit Executive, Chief Compliance Officer(CCO), Group Head, Internal Control and Enhancement Group(GH, ICEG)and/or the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer respectively. All stakeholders (internal and external) are key and therefore expected to play a vital role in deterring and detecting malpractices, wrongdoing or irregularity while the Board and Management provides assurance to all whistleblowers that there will be no reprisal by way of harassment or victimization arising from blowing the whistle.

                    <br> <br> It is pertinent to note that this policy does not replace but complement the firm's approved internal control, policies and guidelines.
                    </p>
